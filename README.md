## About
Mega Man X8 16-bit is a reimagining of the PS2 original with SNES styled graphics. The aim was to demake X8 in a similar feel to the first three Mega Man X games, while trying to actually finish a low-scope fangame. This fangame is fully playable from start to finish with X and runs on Godot Engine 3.5.
