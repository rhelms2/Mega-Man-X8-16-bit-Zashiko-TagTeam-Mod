8/23

- Heart tank selection per character in armor select
- Fixed ridechaser spawning on character glitch
- Fixed stage rotate glitch for primrose and double boss spawn

8/28

- subtank only fills active player's health and only active player can fill it by collecting pickups (Needs more testing/balancing)

8/29

- Special bar now mostly appears correctly: exception when x is icarus and axl is in team
- Can't switch characters during special move
- Ammo for all special moves reset when one is used, making chaining impossible
- Fixed bug where red health was showing on the wrong health bar


Bugs to fix:

- Graphical (might be Linux specific!):
	- Invisible walls in trilobyte stage
	- water not showing correctly on Noah's park
- Pause menu: 
	- health bar appears unfilled for characters with lower max health
- Stage clear glitches:
	- On returning to stage select with zero, add_collectibles_to_inactive_player causes softlock because of previously freed instance
	- Weapon equip scene causes a few crashes, both with X and Axl 
- Sometimes Heart tank collection freezes the game?
- Freeze during fade out on death on dark mantis
- Zero maintaining dash speed in air between switching in/out

Features to implement:

- Fix cutscenes to load which character dynamically instead of just at start of stage
- Make Axl automatically hover when shooting in air
