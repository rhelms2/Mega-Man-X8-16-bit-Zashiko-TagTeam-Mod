8/22

Progress:

- Extra life pickup icon switches with active character
- Correct ride armor sprites set (see bug below related to this)
- No stage reset until both players die 
- playing 1 player mode doesn't cause game crash
- fixed zeros weapons
- fixed weird armor capsule bug
- fixed portals in Primrose stage

Bugs noticed:

- Pause menu glitched out
- X's armor sprites staying visible even on character switch on ride armor
- Zero maintaining dash speed in air between switching in/out
- 1st Heart tank collection freezes the game 
- Stage rotate in primrose breaks for secondary character
- Ride chaser spawns on character at start of stage (why?) 

Features to implement:

- Heart tank selection in armor select
- Weapon bar staying in the same place, not fading unless in ride vehicle
- Disable hotswap for inactive characters
- Shared giga attack bar
