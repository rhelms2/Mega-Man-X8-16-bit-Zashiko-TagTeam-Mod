8/23

- Hotswap working and tested
- Pause menu focus being set correctly and able to switch weapons accurately for all characters
- Heart tank selection per character in armor select

Bugs to fix:

- Invisible walls in trilobyte stage
	- Similar graphical bug: water not showing correctly on Noah's park
- Pause menu: health bar appears unfilled for characters with lower max health
- On returning to stage select with zero, add_collectibles_to_inactive_player causes softlock because of previously freed instance
- Weapon equip scene causes a few crashes
- Freeze during fade out on death on dark mantis for some reason
- 1st Heart tank collection freezes the game 
- Stage rotate in primrose breaks completely
- Ride chaser spawns on character at start of stage (why?) 
- Zero maintaining dash speed in air between switching in/out

Features to implement:
