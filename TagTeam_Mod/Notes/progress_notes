////////////

Bugs to fix:

- Enemy: conjuntivite electric attack has unpredictable behavior

- Pause menu: 
	- health bar appears unfilled for characters with lower max health

- when ontop of moving blocks, switching characters will move you slightly

- secondary character will start flashing after entering a teleporter for a short amount of time

- Zero maintaining dash speed in air between switching in/out

- Awakened Zero boss fight super weak to Axl and X's giga attacks (same as the base version of the repo...)

- Combo section: double penalty for inactive character taking damage? Also can't be beaten with only zero (MAY BE FIXED, NEEDS TESTING)
	- Look at ComboSection.gd

- if a character dies after switching, dead character will be playable and invincible, switching is disabled (NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED/CONFIRMED AFTER ADJUSTMENTS TO SWITCH SYSTEM)

- Freeze during fade out on death on dark mantis (NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED/CONFIRMED AFTER ADJUSTMENTS TO SWITCH SYSTEM)

- Falling into void sometimes has odd behavior (NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED/CONFIRMED AFTER ADJUSTMENTS TO SWITCH SYSTEM)

- When beating beating boss with ride chaser, current character will dash into the wall and die and secondary will be teleported into the ground resulting in a softlock (NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED/CONFIRMED AFTER ADJUSTMENTS TO CRUSH CHECKING)

Features to implement:

- Adjust character select screen so you can start with just one character?
