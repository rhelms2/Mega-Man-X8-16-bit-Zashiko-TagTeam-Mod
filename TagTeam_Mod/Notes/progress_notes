8/29

- Special bar now mostly appears correctly: exception when x is icarus and axl is in team
- Can't switch characters during special move

- Fixed stage clear glitches

8/30

- Fixed fire dash weapon get screen combo
- Ultimate X and Beta Zero now working
- Fixed recoverable health graphical bug
- Fixed reparenter game crash bug
- Fixed freeze on heart tank collect in pandamonium stage
- Troia base: getting hit as secondary player now lowers ranking during combo section
- Added switch cooldown time
- Added invulnerability duration after character dies and new character is switched in

Bugs to fix:

- Falling into void has odd behavior

- Combo section: double penalty for inactive character taking damage?

- Graphical (might be Linux specific!):
	- Invisible walls in trilobyte stage
	- water not showing correctly on Noah's park
	- Falling ice in Central White is invisible

- Pause menu: 
	- health bar appears unfilled for characters with lower max health

- when ontop of moving blocks, switching characters will move you slightly

- secondary character will start flashing after entering a teleporter for a short amount of time

- if a character dies after switching, dead character will be playable and invincible, switching is disabled

- Freeze during fade out on death on dark mantis

- Zero maintaining dash speed in air between switching in/out

- Awakened Zero boss fight super weak to Axl's giga attack

Features to implement:

- Make zero weapons show up with 2 party members (one being zero)
- Fix cutscenes to load which character dynamically instead of just at start of stage
- Adjust starting max health?
- Make Axl automatically hover when shooting in air (?)
